# minesweeper-API

## The Game
Develop the classic game of Minesweeper

## What to build (prioritized)
 * `Make it a playable Demo`
   * Design and implement a (non-documented) RESTful API for the game
   * Ability to start a new game and preserve/resume the old ones
   * When a cell with no adjacent mines is revealed, all adjacent squares will be revealed (and repeat)
   * Time tracking
   * Detect when game is over
 * `Make it public-available`
   * Ability to select the game parameters: number of rows, columns, and mines 
   * Ability to 'flag' a cell with a question mark or red flag
   * Persistence
   * Implement an API client library for the API designed above. Ideally, in a different language, of your preference, to the one used for the API
   * Ability to support multiple users/accounts

## Offered Deliverables (given time and expectations):
 * Accesible endpoint for the API - only playable via simulated REST calls
 * Code in a public Github repo
 * README file with the decisions taken and important notes
